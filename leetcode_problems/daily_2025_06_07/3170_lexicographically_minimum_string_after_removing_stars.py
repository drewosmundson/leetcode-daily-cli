Problem #3170: Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars
Difficulty: Medium
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-minimum-string-after-removing-stars/

You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your 
task is to remove all '*' characters.
While there is a '*', do the following operation:
Delete the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. If 
there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.
Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '*' 
characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aaba*"
Output: "aab"
Explanation:
We should delete one of the 'a' characters with '*'. If we choose s[3], s 
becomes the lexicographically smallest.
Example 2:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: "abc"
Explanation:
There is no '*' in the string.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists only of lowercase English letters and '*'.
The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all '*' characters.
